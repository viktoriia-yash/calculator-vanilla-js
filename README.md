# Calculator
This project is a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum. The main goal was to build a basic calculator. To create this project, I used:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS3.</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting.</li>
</ul>

The previous version didn't satisfy me, so I decided to build it from scratch. In the end, I got a calculator app with keyboard support and a new design.

The final working result you can find here: <a href="https://superb-donut-123f5f.netlify.app/">Netlify</a>
